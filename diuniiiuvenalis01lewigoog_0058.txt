SATIRA 111.

Protogenes aliquis vel Diphilus aut Erimarchus,
qui gentis vitio numquam partitur amicum,

solus habet3 nam cum facilem stillavit in aurem
exiguum de naturae patriaeque veneno,

limine summoveor, perierunt ternpore longi
servitii; nusquam minor est iactura clientis.

l Quod porro officium, ne nobis blandiar, aut quod
pauperis hic meritum, si curet nocte togatus

· currere, cum praetor lictorem impellat et ire
praecipitem iubeat, dudum vigilantibus orbis,

ne prior Albinam et Modiam collega salutet?
divitis hic servi claudit latus ingenuorum

filius; alter enim quantum in legione tribuni
accipiunt donat Calvinae vel Catienae,

ut semel atque iterumsuper illurn palpitet, at tu,¹
cum tibi vestiti iacies scorti pldcet, haeres

et dubitas alta Chionen deducere sella.

friend, bot keeps him to hinrseli3 ior when he has instilled into
his ready ear a particle oi the poison oi his own nature and
country, I am elbowed away from the threshold‚ my long period
of servitude hes been tlrrown away. N owhere is the pitohing
overboard of a client of less account.

What, moreovsr, are the services oi the poor man-to speak
plain truth-—what are his good turns ucrlh herc, if lre' makes
it his business to hurry in his toga before daybrealr, when the
praetor lciccsels is urging on his lictor, and hidding him go* with
