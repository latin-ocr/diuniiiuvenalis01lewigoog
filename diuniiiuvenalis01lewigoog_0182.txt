SATIRA Χ.

Δ practerea minimus gelido iam in corpore sanguis
febre calet sola, circumsilit ¹agmine facto

morborum omne genus, quorum si nomina quaeras,
promptius expediam quot amaverit Hippia moechos, ιω

killed in a single autumn, how many pertners have been chceted
by Basilus, how many words by Hirrus how many men tall
Marna has connection with in a single day, how many pupils

beard used to sound when I was a young man. One is wcak in
the shouldcr, another in the loins‚ another in the hip; another
has lost both his eyes, and envies the one-eyed; another‘s blood·
less lips receive their foed from others' fingers Tho man who

sight 01 his dinncr, now gapes merely, like the young 01 a
