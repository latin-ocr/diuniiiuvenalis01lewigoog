SATIRA VI.

accipis uxorem, de qua citharoedus Echion
aut Glaphyrus fiat pater Ambrosiusque choraules
longa per angustos figamus pulpita vicos,
ornentur postes et grandi ianua lauro, Ι
ut testudineo tibi, Lentule, conopeo eo
nobilis Euryalum mirmillonem exprimat infans.

Nupta senatori comitata est Hippia ludium
ad Pharon et Nilum famosaque moenia Lagi,
prodigia et mores urbis damnante Canopo.
immemor illa domus et coniugis atque sororis 8⁵
nil patriae indulsit, plorantesque improba natos,
utque magis stupeas, ludos Paridemque reliquit.
sed quamquam in maguis opibus plumaque paterna
et segmentatis dormisset parvula cunis,
contempsit pelagus; lamam contempserat olim, 90
cuius apud molles minima est iactura cathedras.
[tyrrhenos igitur fluctus lateque sonantem

in love withl You receive uuile, by whom the harper Echion,
or Glaphyrus, and Ambrosius the choral flute-player, may bc-
comc a father. Let us erect long soalioldings along the narrow
streete, let the doorposts and gatc be adorned with a hugo bay,
in order that, in your bed inlaid with tortoiseshell, Ο Lentu-
lus! your noble infant may present the image ci Euryalus, tha
gladiator!

Hippia, married to a senator, accompanied a gladiator to Pharos
and the N ilc, and the iniamons walls oi Lagus,-Can0pus t'tacls
condemning the portcntous exhibitions, and manners oi our city.
This woman, unmindlul oi her home aud her husband and her
’ sister, showed no regard ior hor country, and sliamelessly descrted
her weeping children, and, to anraze you still more, Paris and
the public gemes But though, as a child, she had slept in great
luxury, on the solt dou'u oi her lather’s house, and in a cradlc
decked with iringes, she made light oi t-hc sea; her reputation
she had long made light of, the loss oi which is held tc be
very trifling among the solt litters of the ludier. So then she

bore up against the Tuscan waves and the wide-soundirigr Ionian,
