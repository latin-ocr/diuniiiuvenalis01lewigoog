help him on, to be driven off straightway to a book oi
reference. ,
ihc English editions oi Juvenal which have come

“ under my notice are that oi Mr. Macleane, and three χ

school-books hy Messrs. Escott, Prior, end Simcox,
respectivcly. Macleane is an editor of masculine judg·
ment, hardly inferior to that oi Heinrich, whose com·
mentary he with justice admires. Ihave sometimes, in
my translation, horrowed a word ora tum oi expression
from him, owing to the fact that it lingered in my
memory, and that I could not find anything better to
replace it. His lailing is in being at times too dogmatic.
Mr. Escott and Mr. Prior have published two excellent
school-books. Ma Simcox, whose Juvenal forms part of
the “ Catena Classicorum,'’ offers some acute suggestions:

ι hut his vice is precisely over-acuteness, a perpetual
’ straining after some meaning, other than the apparent
one, oi aword or a passage, which at times makes his
notes very misicading to the school-hoy, or else absolute
nonsense.⁴²‘

Mr. Mayor's Juvenal I have not had the advantage oi
seeing, except the text and the notes to Satira i and
Satire iii 1-9. I have frequently inquired ior the entire
work, and have always been told that it was out oi print,

⁹ Ea yn, Notas toi 59-62, iii 34-36 (quemlibet, “the most expensire
s gladiators''), 221, iv 48 104, vs 33 104, vii 193 194, viii 162, x 18 21,
xi 6 203, xiii 28, xiv 2-9 102 133 217 253·254 257 298, xv 117, and
the exquisitely ridiculous note at xvi 46. Mr. Sirncox’s Introduction
commences in these words, ‘¹ About the liie oi Juvenal, only three things
can be said to be known: that hc uas tho heir oi a trccdmau, that ha
practised declamation, and that hc was banished ior adronting an actor.’'
This is not a proper way oi introducing tho Auctor to the schoolhoy'a
notice. lione oi these things aminoen.
