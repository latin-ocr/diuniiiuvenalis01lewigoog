nescioquis titulos Aegyptius atque Arabarches, 130
cuius ad effigiem non tantum meiere fas est

· vestibulisabeunt veteres lassique clientes,
votaque deponunt, quamquam longissima coenae
spes homini: cauli} miseris atque ignis emendus. thry·
optima silvarum interea pelagique vorabit ’ 13⁵
rex horum, vacuisque toris tantum ipse iacebit
nam de tot pulchris ct latis orbibus ettam
antiquis una comedunt patrimonia mensa
nullus iam parasitus erit. sed quisserat istas
luxuriae sordes? quanta est gula, quaesibi totos 1⁴0
ponit apros, animal propter convivia natum!
poena tamon praesens, cum tu deponis amictus
turgidus et crudum pavonem in balnea portas.
hinc subitae mortes atque intestata senectus;
it nova nec tristis per cunctas fabula coenas, 145
ducitur iratis plaudendum funus amicis.

1⁴3· crudus.

“Aegyptius and Arabarches '' has dated tc place his titles of
honour, at whose image one may, without sacrilego, commit
more than one kind ol nuisance. The old and wcaricd clienta
leave the porch and give up their hopeS, though the cxpectation
oi a dinner is the most long-lived of cll in man: the poor
fellows must buy their pot-herba and firing. In the meanwhile
their patron will devour tha choicest produce of iorests and ἵ
sea, and will recline in solitary state cn the couches empty of
cll but himself ,· for cll sc many beautiful and broad and antique
round tables these people devorrr their patrirnonics at a single
course. Soon there will be no parasite ; but who will bear such
sordid luxury as thisl What gluttony is that which scrvcs up
lor itself whole boars, an animal created ior banquetsl Yet
the penalty is at hand when you lay asida your clothes, gorgcd
with foed, and carry an undigested pcacoclr to the bath Hence,
sudden deaths and intestata ohl age. The new but not sorrowful
tidings go the round cf all the dinner-tablcs, and your luneral
comas forth amidst the applausc of disappointed friends.
