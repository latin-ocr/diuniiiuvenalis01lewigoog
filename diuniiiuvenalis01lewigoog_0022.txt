SATIRA l.

Crispinus, Tyrias humero revocante lacernas,

ventilet aestivum digitis sudantibus aurum,

neo sufferre queat maioris pondera gemmae,

difficile est satiram non seribere. iram quis iniquae ³0
tam patiens urbis, tarn senene, ut teneat se,

causidici nova curn veniat lectica hluthonis ’

plena ipsu, posthunc magni delator amici

et cito rapturus de nobilitate comesa

quod superest, quem Massa timet, quem munere palpat 35
Carus et a trepido Thymele summissa Iatin03

cum te summoveant qui testamenta merentur

noctibus, in eoelum quos evehit optima summi

nune via processus vetulae vesica beatae?

unciolam Proculeius habet, sed Gillo deuncem, 40
partes quisque suas ad mensuram inguinis heres.

accipiat sane mercedem sanguinis et sic

palleat, ut nudis pressit qui calcibus anguem,

aut Lugdunensem rhetor dicturus ad aram.

of the rabble ol the Nile, thc born slave ol Canopus, with his
shoulder hitching up his Tyrion eloalr, airs his summer gold
ring on his sweaty fingers‚ and is unable ιο support the weight
of a heavior gem, it is difficult not ιο write Satire. For who so
tolerant ol the injustices ot tho town, so stcelcd, as to contain
himself when the new litter ol Matho the lawyer comes up,
filled by the great man, aud atter him he that informed upon
his powerful friend, 'and who will soon clutchall that remains
of the devourcd nobility, whom Massa himself fears, ‚whom
Carus tries to whcedle with a bribe, and Thymele sent privately
by the trembling Latinus; when men clbow you out of the way
who earn legacies by night work, who are raised to the skies by
what is now tha best road to the highest adranccment-tha
letch ol some rich old hagl Proculeius gets a paltry twelfth
os tlrepr·0per·tp,b11t Gillo elenen-twelfths3 each inherits his share
' in proper-tion to his powers. Let him receive, lor what Ι care,
the price 'ol his lile-blood, 'and be just as pala as one who has ·
trodden bare-footod on a snake, or a rhetorician about to speak
