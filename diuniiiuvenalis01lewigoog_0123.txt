94 D. IUNII IUVENALIS

efferat et patruos, an sit victurus adulter

post ipsam, quid enim maius dare numina possunt?
heec tamen ignorat quid sidus triste minetur

> Saturni, quo laeta Venus se proferat astro, . 5⁷0
qui mensis damnis, quae dentur tempora lucro ;

illius occursus etiam vitare mement0,

in cuius manibus, ocu pinguia sucina, tritas

si mediocris erit, spatium lustrabit utrimque
metarum, et sortes ducet frontemque manumque

will not go with him if recalled by the calculations ol Thrasyllus
When it is her lancy to be carried as far as the first milestone,
the luel-y hour is taken from a book3 it the corner of her eye
itches when rubbed, she consults her horoscope before calling
for salve. Though she be 1yingsick, no time sae'ms more suit-
able ior taking food than that which Petosiris has directed.

Il she be a common person, she will traverso the space on both
sides ol the goals, and will draw lots‚ and will hold out her
