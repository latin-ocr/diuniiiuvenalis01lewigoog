SATIRA XIV.

Sponte tamen iuvenes imitantur cetera, solam
inviti quoque avaritiam exercere iubentur.
fallit enim vitium specie virtutis et umbra,
cum sib triste habitu vultuque et veste severum, no
nec dubie tamquam frugi laudatur avarus,
tamquamssparcus homo ec rerum tutela suarum
certa magis quam si fortunas servet easdem
Hesperidum serpens aut Ponticus. adde quod hunc de
quo loquor egregium populus putet acquirendi υς
artificem: quippe his crescunt patrimonia fabris:
sed crescunt quocumque modo maioraque fiunt
incude assidua semperque ardente camino
et pater ergo animi felices eredit avaros
qui miratur opes, qui nulla exempla beati 120
pauperis esse putat. iuvenes hortatur uh illam
ire viam pergant et eidem incumbere sectae.
sunt quaedam vitiorum elementn3 his protinus illos

Still, of their own accord, youths imitate the other vicos3
avarica alone thoy are bidden to practise, even against their
wilh For this vice deceives by an appearance and shedow of
virtue, inasmuch as ,it is subdued in bearing, severe in counie-
nance and sitire, aud the miser is praised unhesitatingly aaa
frugal person, as an economical man, aud a protector of his own
property, more sure than if the serpent of the Hesperides or that
of Pontus watched over these same possessions. Add that the
people deam him of whom Iam speaking an extraordinary
master of the art of acquiring; since patrimonica grow through ’
such workmon as these-aye, they grow by all kinds of ways
and are made longer on un unceasing anvil and in a forge that
is always burning. So, hhen, the father too considers misere
to be happy in their disposition3 he who admires rvealth, who
thinks there arc no examples of a poor mun who is hlessed.
He exhorhs his youths to continue on that read, and to stick to
the same schooh There ara certain elements oi the vices3 with
these he imbues them at naming, aud compols them to master
