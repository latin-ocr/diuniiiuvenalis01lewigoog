142 ¹ D. wrm IUVENALIS ·

iamne igitur laudas quod de sapientibus alter
ridebat, quoties dc limine moverat unum
protuleratque pedem, flebat contrarius auctor?
scd facilis cuivis rigidi censura cachinni ;
mirandum est, unde illc oculis suffecerit humor,

wearing the Tyrian hangings ol an embroidered toga depending
from his shoulders, and a huge crown oi such a circumferenco
as no single neck is equal to l-seeing that the public slave .
holds this, all in a sweat, and, lest the Consul should bc loo
much pleased with himself, rides in the same chariot Add to
this the bird which rises from his irory sceptro ; on that side
the trumpeters, on this the clienta preceding him in long army,
and the Quirites all in white by his bridle, whom the dole buried
