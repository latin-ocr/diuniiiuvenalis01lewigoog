146 D. IUNII IUVENALIS

posse volunt sed quae praeclara et prospera tanti,

ut rebus laetis par sit mensura malorum?

huius, qui trahitur, praetextam sumere mavis

an Fidenarum Gabiorumque esse potestas

etde mensura ius dicere, vasa minora

frangere pannosus vacuis aedilis Ulubris?

crgo quid optandum foret ignorasse lateris

Seianum 3 nam qui nimios optabat honores ¹

et nimias poscebat opes, numerosa parabat 105
excelsae turris tabulata, unde altior esset

casus et impulsae praeceps immane ruinae

quid Crassos, quid Pompeios evertit, et illum,

ad sua qui domitos deduxit flagra Quirites?

summus nempe locus nulla non arte petitus 110
magnaque numinibus vota exaudita malignis.

ad generum Cereris sine caede ac vulnere pauci
descendunt reges et sicca morte tyranni.

one wish to have the power to do it. But what brilliant fortune,
what prosperity, can be oi such great value aa to be acor-ib tlte
comitiae that the measure of misiortunes should be equal to thc
good lucki Would you prefer to assume the praetexta othim
who is being dragged along, or to bc the magistrate of Fidenae
or Gabii, and to pronounce decisions about measures, and to
break up pots below the standard, a raggcd aedile in empty
Ulubrael You admit, then, Sejanus to have been ignorant of
what would have been desirable sor· him .· lor he that desired too
great honours, and asked for too rnuch wealth, was preparing
story upon story of a loity tower from which his tall should be
the greater,and frightiul the headlong desccntof the strichen ruin.
What was it that destroyed the Crassi, what the Pompeys, and
him that brought the Quirites iu subjection under his lashl
Assuredly it was the highest position sought by every art, and
their ambitious prayers heard too well hythe unkind deities.
Few kings descend to Ceres’ son-in-law without slaughter and
wouuds, few tyrauts by a bloodless death.
