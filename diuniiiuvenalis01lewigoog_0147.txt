118 D. IUNII IUVENALIS

sic laudamus equum facili cui plurima palma

servet et exsultat rauco victoria circo.

nobilis hic, quocumque venit de gramine, ouius ⁶0

clara suga ante ahos et primns in aequore pultis3

sed venale pecus Corythae posteritas et

Hirpini, si rara iugo Victoria sedit.

nil ibi maiorum respectus, gratia nulla

umbrarum; dominos pretiis mutare iubentur - 65

exiguis, trito ducunt epiredia collo ’

segnipedes dignique molam versare Nepotis.

ergo ut miremur te, non tua, primum aliquid da

quod possim titulis incidere, praeter honores

quos illis damus ac dedimus quihus omnia debes. 70
Haec satis ad iuvenem, quem nobis sama superbum

. tradit et inflatum plenumque Nerone propinquo ;

rarus enim ferme sensus communis in illa

fortuna ; sed te censeri laude tuorum,

58. facile, facilis. 66. tritoque trahunt.

. Assuredly we praise a horse as swiit, on the ground that many

a palm os tra‘uruph glows for the easy winnor, while victory
exulta in the hoarse circus. Ha is noble, from whatever pastura
he comes whose speed is distinguished before the others, whose
’ dust is first on the plain. But the descendants oi Corytha and
Hirpinus are hut cattle ior sala if victory has sat rarely on their
‘ yohe. In their casa there iano regard forancestors, no favour
to be pairaed from shades3 they are forced to change their owners
for small prices3 they draw carts, with galled neck, slow of foot,
and worthy only to turn the mill of Nepos. Therefore, that
we may admira you, and not yours, first give me something
which I may ba able to inscribe among yonr titles besides those
honours which we give, and always have given to those to whom
you owe everything.

Enough on the youth whom fame reports to us as proud'and
puffed up and full of his relationship to N ero. Iudeed, a senso
cf what is due to others is commonly rare in that condition ot
life But 1 should balaath, Ponticus, for you to be estimated
