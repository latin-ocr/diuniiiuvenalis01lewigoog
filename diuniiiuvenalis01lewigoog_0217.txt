188 D. IUNII IUVENALIS

ut sit magna tamen certe lenta ira deorum est ; ιω
si curant igitur cunctos punire nocentes,

quando ad me venient? sed et exorabile numen

fortasse experiar; solet his ignoscere multi
committunt eadem diverso crimina iato;

ille crucem sceleris pretium tulit, hic diadema” 105
sic animum dirae trepidum formidine culpae

confirmant. Tunc te sacra ad delubra vocantem
praecedit, trahere immo ultro ac vexare paratus.

naui cum magna malae superest audacia causae,

with different destinies One receives crucifixion as the price of
his villany, another a diadem ” Thus they harden their souls,
trembling with the {right caused by their dread offense. Then,
uheu you sumtuon him to the sacred shrine, he goes there before
you, aye, even ready ol his own accord ιο drag you along and
harass you3 for when great impudence comes ιο the aid of a
bad cause, it is taken by many for honest confidence. He is
acting just such a force as the runaway slave in witty Catullus
You, poor man, cry out with a voice to beat a Stentor, or rather
as loud as the Gradivus oi Homer, “ Do you hear this, Jupiter,
and don't oven move your lips when you ought ιο have spoken

out, though you had been of marble or bronze‘l Or why οιι ¹
