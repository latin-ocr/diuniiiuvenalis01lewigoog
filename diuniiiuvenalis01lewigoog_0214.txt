empire oi the deep, nor was thero a grim Pluto, with his Sieilian
wife, nor the wheel, nor the Furias, nor tha rook, nor the
punishment of the blaok vulture 3 but marry shades without
infernal iringa Improbity was a marvel in that age They
thought it a great impiety, and ono to be expiated by death, if
a young man had not risen up before an old man, or a bey
before any ouo that had got a heard, although he himself might

books, and such as ought to be expiated by tte sacrifice os a
garlanded lamb. If I sea a man above the hard, of true probity,
