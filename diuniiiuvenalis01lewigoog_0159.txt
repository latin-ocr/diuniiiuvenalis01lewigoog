prodita laxabant portarum claustra tyrannis
exsulibus iuvenes ipsius consulis et quos
magnum aliquid dubia pro libertate deceret,
:quod miraretur cum Coclite Mucius et quae
imperii fines Tiberinum virgo natavit.
occulta ad patres produxit erimina servus
matronis lugendus; at illos verbera iustis
afficiunt poenis et legum prima securis.

Malo pater tibi sit Thersites, dummodo tusis
Aeacidae similis Vulcaniaque arma capessas, 270
quam te Thersitae similem producat Achilles.
et tamen ut longe repetas longeque revolvas
nomen, ab infami gentem deducis asylo:
maiorum primus quisquis fuit ille tuorum, ’
aut pastor fuit aut illud quod dicere nolo. ars-

betrayed bolts of the city-gotes to the exiled tyrants were the
youthful sons of the Consul himself, the very men from whom
some great exploit on behall of still doubtful liberty was to be
expected, such as Mucius in unison with Cocles might admira,
and the virgin who swam the Tiber, tlrerr the limit of our
empira He that revealed to the senators the secret crime was
a slave, one day to be lamented by matrons‚ while stripes inflict
upon the others a just punishment, and the exe the first that
was asad render the rer'yo of laws.

I would prefer that your father were Thersites, provided you
resemble Aeacides, and can wield the arms of Vulcan’s making,
than that Achilles should beget you in the likeness of Thersites.
And after all, from whatever distance you trace back, and from
whatever distance you unrcll your name, you derive your family
from an ignoble repair. That first of your ancestors, whoever
he was, was either a shepherd, or something which I decline to
mention
