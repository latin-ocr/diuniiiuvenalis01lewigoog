SATIRA 1 V.

SA TIRA IV.

CCE iterum Crispinus et est mihi saepe vocandus
ad partes, monstrum nulla virtute redemptum
aritiis, aegrae solaque libidine fomes
deliciae; viduas tantum aspernatur adulter.
quid refert igitur, quantis iumenta fatiget 5
porticibus, quanta nemorum vectetur in umbra,

iugera quot vicina foro, quas emerit aedes?

nemo malus felix, minime corruptor et idem ‹
incestae, eum quo nuper vittata iacebat

sanguine adhuc vivo terram subitura sacerdos. 10

si lecisset idem, caderet sub iudice morum.

nam quod turpe bonis, Titio Seioquc, decebat

Crispinum3 quid agas, cum dira et foedior omni

3. aeger; fortis. 4 deliciar3 vidune; spernatur.

the same timo incestuouS, with whom not long ago thera layo
filleted priestess‚ destined to be put under the ground with her
life-blood still warni. But now oi lighler deeds: and yet
another, if hc had done the same, would have been condemned
by our censor. For what would bo ‹lisgraceiul ior good men,
ior Titius and Seius, uras becoming to Crispinus. What are you
