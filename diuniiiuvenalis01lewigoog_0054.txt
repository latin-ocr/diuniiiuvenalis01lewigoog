aestuat occultis animus semperque tacendis? 50
nil tibi se debere putat, nil conferet· umquam,
participem qui te secreti fecit honesti;
carus erit Verri, qui Verrem temporeque malt
accusare potest. tanti tibi non sit opaci
omnis arena Tagi quodque in mare volvitur aurum, ss
ut somno careas ponendaque praemia sumas
tristis et a magno semper timearis amico! Ι

Quae nunc divitibus gens acceptissima nostris
et quos praecipue fugiam, properabo fateri,
nec pudor obstabit. nou possum ferre, Quirites, 60
Graecam urbem. quamvis quota portio faecis Achaei!
iarn pridem Syrus in Tiberim defluxit Orontes,
et linguam et mores et curn tibicine chordas
obliquas, nec non gentilia tympana secum

have to be disgorged, and always he icared by your powerful
friend.

What race is now most in favour with our rich men, and
what people Iwould particularly shnn, I uill hasten to tell you,
nor shall shame prevent me. I cannot bear, Romans, a Greek
city3 and yet, how small a portion of our drcgs is irem Graecei
Long since, Syrien Orontes has flowed into the Tiber, and has
brought with it its language and manners, and with the piper the
oblique chorus, and the national tambourines, end the girls
made to stand for hire at the circus. Hie thither, ye who have
a fancy ior a ioreign lrarlot in· an embroidered turben! Thai
