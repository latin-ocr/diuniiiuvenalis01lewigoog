sanna νι. 99

subtrahitur clivoque latus pendente recedit 650
illam ego non tulerim, quae computat et scelus ingens
sana facit spectant subeuntem fata mariti

Alcestim et, similis si permutatio detur,

morte viri cupiant animam servare catellae.

occurrent multae tibi Belides atque Eriphylae ⁶55
mane, Clytaemnestram nullus non vicus habebit.

hoc tantum refert, quod Tyndaris illa bipennem

insulsam et fatuam dextra laevaque tenebat3

at nuno res agitur tenui pulmone rubetae,

sed tamen et ferre, si praegustabit Atrides 660
Pontica ter victi cautus medicamina regis,

mountain is withdrawn, while its side recedes from the hanging
declivity. The woman 1 cannot endure is she who calculatos
and commite a great crime in her lull sensas. They see, ot tae
play, Alcestis undergoing death for her husband, and ii a similar
substitution uere accorded them, they would with, attha price
of a husband’s death, to save the lile oi a lapdog. Many Belides
and Eriphylae will run up against you ol a morning ; no street
that will not have ite Clytaemnestra. The only difference is
thie, that the daughter ol Tyndarus in question wielded astupid
senseless axe with right and lelt hand3 but nouadays tha
business is done with the delicate lung ol a toad-and yet with
the steel too, if har wory Atrides shall have tasted belorehand
some ol the antidotes from Pontus ol the thrice-conquered

king.
