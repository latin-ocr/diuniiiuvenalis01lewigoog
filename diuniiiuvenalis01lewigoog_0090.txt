SA TIRA Vl.

Ι frondibus et culmo vicinarumque ferarum

pellibus, haud similis tibi, Cynthia, nec tibi, cuius
turbavit nitidos exstinctus passer ocellos,

sed potanda ferens insentibus ubera magnis

et saepe horridior glandem ructante marito. 10
quippe aliter tunc orbe novo coeloque recenti

vivebant homines, qui rupto robore nati

compositive luto nullos habuere parentes.

multa pudicitiae veteris vestigia forsan

aut aliqua exstiterint et sub Iove, sed Iove nondum 15
barbato, nondum Graecis iurare paratis ’

per caput alterius, cum furem nemo timeret

caulibus et pomis, et aperto viveret horto.

paulatim deinde ad superos Astraea recessit

hac comite, atque duae pariter fugere sorores. eo
antiquum etvetus est alienum, Postume, lectum
concutere atque sacri genium contemnere inleri;

omne aliud crimen mox ferrea protulit actae,

viderunt primos argentea secula moechos.

wild beasts of the neighbourhood 3 not like to pou, Cynthia,
nor to you whose bright eyes the death ol a sparrow clauded;
but bearing breasts to be quaffed by her huge infante, and often
more uncouth than her acorn-belching husband. For indeed
men were living differently then, with a new world and sky
· fresh-made, who, born from the riren oak or eompounded oi
clay, had no parents. Many vestiges oi old-world chastity‚ or
some at least, may perhaps hare existed even under Jove, but
Jove not yet boarded, when Greeks wore not yet prepared to
sw'ear by another’s head, when no one icared a thiel ior his
cabbeges end apples, and every cac lived with an unenclosed
garder. By ‹legrees afterwards Astraea withdrew to the gods
above, with her ior a companion, and the two sisters iled at the
same time. It is aar ancient aud old-world practice, Postumus,
to trespass on another's bed, and to conterno the genius of the
sacred conch. Erery other crime the period oi iron soon pro-
duced; the adver age behold the first adulterers
