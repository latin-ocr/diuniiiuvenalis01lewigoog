202 D. 1 UNI! IUVENALIS

marmoribus vincens Fortunae atque Herculis aedem, 90

ut spado vincebat Capitolia nostra Posides.

dum sie ergo habitat Cetronius, imminuit rem,

fregit opcs3 neo parva tamen mensura relictae

partis erat: toturn hane turbavit filius amens

dum meliore novas attollit marmore villas. 95
Quidam sortiti metuentem sabbeta patrem

nil praeter nubes et coeli numen adorant,

nec distare putant humana carne suillam,

qua pater abstinuit, mox et praeputia ponunt

Romanas autem soliti contemnere leges '

Iudaicum ediscunt et servant ae metuentius,

tradidit arcano quodcumque volumine blasae,

non monstrare vias eadem nisi sacra colenti,

quaesitum ad fontem solos deducere verpus.

sed pater in causa, cui septima quaeque fnit lux ως

ignava et partem vitae non attigit ullam.

“ passing the temples oi Fortune and of Hercules aa much as the
eunuch Posides surpassed our Capitols. While, then, Cetronius
housad himself in this way, he diminished his property, ha
impeired his fortune3 yet the amount oi the portion left was by
no means small. His insane son sqnandered the whole of this,
while he raised up new villas of still finer nrarble.

Some, whose lot it has been to have a father paying respect
to sabbatha, worship nothing except the clouds and the divinity
oi the sky, and think the flesh of swine, from which theiriather
abstained, does not differ from that of human beings 3 before
long they even undergo circumcision. Moreover, having been
went to despise tha lasus of Rome, they make themselves
masters of, and observo and respect, the J ewish code, whatever
Moses has taught in his mystic volume3 not to show the way
except to one who proetises the sarna rites3 to guide the eir·
cumeised alone to the soughttor well. But tha father is ‚te

blame, to whom every seienth day was one of idlenass, and uas
connected with no part ot tte cluties of lite.
