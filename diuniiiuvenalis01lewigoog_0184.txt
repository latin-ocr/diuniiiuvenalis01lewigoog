SATIRA X.

attendas, quantum de legibus ipse queratur
fatorum et nimio de stamine, cum ridet acris
Antilochi barbam ardentem, curn quaerit ab omni,
quisquis adest 0001110, cur haec intempore duret,

quod facinus dignum tam longo admiserit 0010. ass
haec eadem Peleus, raptum cum luget Achillem,

atque alius, cui 100 1111000111 lugere natantem.

incolumi Troia Priamus venisset ad umbras

Assaraci, magnis solemnibus, Hectore funus

portante'ac reliquis fratrum 00111011110111101 260
Iliadum 1001111100, ut primos edere planetus

Cassandra inciperet scissaque Polyxena palla,

si 10101 exstinctus diverso tempere, quo non

coeperat audaces Paris aedificare carinas.

longa dies igitur quid contulit? omnia vidit 265
eversa et flammis Asiam ferroque cadentem.

tunc miles tremulus posita tulit arma tiara

et ruit ante aram summi Ievis, ut vetulus 1100,

Priam would have gone to the shade 01 Assaracus, ’01111 Troy
standing, with great solemnities, with Hector and all 1110 brothers
carrying the bier on their shoulders, amidst the tears of 1110 Trojan
women, 00 00011 as Cassandra had began to lead off 1110 first wail-
