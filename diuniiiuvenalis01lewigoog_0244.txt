SATIRA XIV.

passuros gestis aequanda pericula rebus.

nullum numen hahes, si sit prudentia; uos te,

nos facimus, Fortuna, deam. mensura tamen quae
sufficiat census, siquis me consulat, edam

in quantum sitis atque fornes et frigora poscunt,

quantum, Epicure, tibi parvis suffecit in hortis,
quantum Socratici ceperunt ante Penates.
numquam aliud natura, aliud sapientia dicit
acribus exemplis videor te claudere. misce

ergo aliquid nostris de moribus, effice summam,
bis septem ordinibus quam lex dignatur Othonia.
haec quoque si rugam trahit extenditque labellum,

sume duos equites, iac tertia quadringenta

si nondum implevi gremium, si panditur ultra,
nec Croesi fortuna umquam nec Persica regna
sufficient animo, nec divitiae Narcissi,

indulsit Caesar cui Claudius omnia, cuius
paruit imperiis uxorem occidere iussus.

315. abest. 316. ts facimus.

perils equivalent to the exploits he aclricved You have uo
divine power where prudence exista. It is we, we who make a
goddess oi you, O Fortuna! However, ii any one asks my
opinion as to what measure of property is sufficient, Ι will tell
you To tho extent that thirst and hunger and cold demand 3
as much as sufficed you in your small gardan, Epicurus5 as
much as tha horne oi Socrates contained before. N ature never
says one thing and philosophy another. Do 1 seern to confine
you by exemplos that are too several Throw in, then, some·
thing from our manners, make up the suni which the law of
Otho regards as fitting ior the F ourteen Rows. Ii this, too, pro·
duces a lrown, and makes you pout your lip, take two knights’
sees-make it a third four hundred If Ihavo not yet filled
your lap, ii it is spread out beyond this, not eron tha fortuna oi
Croesus nor tho reulnrs oi Persia willever satisiy your inclinations,
nor the riehes oi Narcissus, to whom Claudius Caesar gava up
everything, whose orders he obuycd when hidden to kill his ruiis
