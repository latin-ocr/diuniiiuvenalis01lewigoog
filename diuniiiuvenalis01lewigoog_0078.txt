SATIRA 1 V.

illustresque animas impune et vindice nullo!

Sicambri, as though from the opposito end oi the world an
anxious express hod come with deshing wing.

And pet, Iwould that he hod rather devoted eren to such

trifles os these the whole of thut period oi violence in which hc ·

and with none to avenge them. But he periched as soon as

he hod begun to be an object ol sear to the rabble. This it
